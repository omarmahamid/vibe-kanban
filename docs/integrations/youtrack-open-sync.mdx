title: YouTrack (Open → To Do) Sync
description: Sync Open YouTrack sprint issues into Vibe Kanban as To Do tasks.
---

This repo includes a small Rust utility that pulls **only "Open"** issues from a specific YouTrack **Agile board + sprint**, and creates matching Vibe Kanban tasks **always in `To Do`** (no state mapping).

## Requirements

- A Vibe Kanban `project_id` (UUID)
- A YouTrack permanent token with permission to read issues/boards
- Agile board id and sprint id (from the YouTrack URL)

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
cargo run -p server --bin sync_youtrack_open -- \
  --project-id <VK_PROJECT_UUID> \
  --youtrack-base-url https://track.personetics.com/youtrack/ \
  --youtrack-token <YOUTRACK_TOKEN> \
  --agile-id 65-52 \
  --sprint-id 66-155467 \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` to actually create tasks.

## How "Open" is detected

By default, the tool looks at the YouTrack custom field named `State` and treats value `Open` (case-insensitive) as open.

Override if your instance uses a different field/value:

```bash
YOUTRACK_STATE_FIELD=Status YOUTRACK_OPEN_VALUE=Open \
  cargo run -p server --bin sync_youtrack_open -- ...
```
